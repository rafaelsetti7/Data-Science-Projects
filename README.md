# Data Science Projects

This repository was created to share some of my projects focusing on data science. The vast majority of these projects were completed during my undergraduate studies. 

Among the techniques showcased in this repository are: Time Series analysis, Regression, Classification, PCA, along with Natural Language Processing features. 

Most of these projects were developed using the R language, with one of them being developed using Python.
