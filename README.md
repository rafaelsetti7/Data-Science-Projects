# Data Science Projects

 This repository was created to share my Data Science projects
 
 Here, I'm sharing some contents related to Time Series forecasting based on Cross-Validation and also Some multivariate tasks, which envolves Discriminant Analisys and Also   Principal Components Analisys.

 Beyond every coding, I was coding at the majority of the time with R language, for each time series analisys and also multivariate analisys.
 
 Finally I'd like to say that the Forecast project was created with the propose of sharing statistical analisys trying to keep it easier for who don't know much about this subject, making me summarize all the info into a more readable language. I also kept the residual analisys away from the final presentation in order to keep it clean for a layman to read and conclude about it.
